# Text detection on manga pages with YOLOR

I trained the **YOLOR [1]** algorithm on the **Manga109 dataset [2]** to detect texts on manga pages.

## Train and test it.
You can use the ``yolor.ipynb`` file to test the model or train it with your own dataset.

## Dataset
I used the **Manga109 dataset [2]** to train my model. If you wish to download it, you can send an application via [this form]( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefUGHUlkDfYlnOKLZlBqRtqlhmZWmhL1_NBfZ24zHOeCoguA/viewform). I used [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) to manage my dataset (split it, apply preprocessing and augmentations), and to easily download it to my python notebook.

## Trained weights
You can download the trained weights [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yEN1xPaFNhnbzyUqomABDlm3c50lXv3W/view?usp=sharing). This is the best overall over 100 epochs of training.

Below is the result of the trained model for a page:
